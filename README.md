# DOS-GUI-Norton-Style
A Norton's Utilities like (G)UI I developed in Turbo Pascal and Assembly. The (G) is inside in parenthesis, because the lirbary is not Graphical but in Text despite the fact it looks like.

Some features of the library.

- Smooth Mouse Movement in arrow shape
- Windows Content Movement with Overlapping Management including Shadows
- Redesigned basic objects like input boxes, drop down menus, buttons etc
- Memory Management
- OnLine Help compiled in one single file .HLP 

Comments inside the source code are in Greek Language. So, find the SetGreek.com file to enable the Greek characters and translate them using google translate.

-OOP Folder : Object Oriented Programming Libraries in Turbo Pascal 7 and inline assembly

-OBJ Folder : Some external Assembly libraries

-FONTS Folder : Some custom DOS fonts I created with my application FontEdit.exe. You can load them in the DosBox with the following syntax: Loadfont filename.syb


Note: *.syb filenames are font symbols you can load.

The character generator (FontEdit) and LoadFont application are also developed under Turbo Pascal, but I really dont remember where the heck I stored the source files.

Just to mention, I designed this DOS User Interface when I was 19 years old !!!

** EDIT 02/11/2024: I found the source code of the QSORT. The original and English-translated versions are inside the QSORT folder. I also added an example folder that contains sample code for using PullDown Menus and other UI Objects.
